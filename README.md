# Feature Management - Unleash
Unleash is an open source feature management solution. It improves the workflow of your development team and leads to quicker software delivery. Unleash increases efficiency and gives teams _full control_ of how and when they enable new functionality for end users. Unleash lets teams ship code to production in _smaller_ releases _whenever_ they want.

Feature toggles make it easy to test how your code works with real production data without the fear that you'll accidentally break your users' experience. It also helps your team work on multiple features in parallel without each maintaining an separate feature branch.

Unleash is the largest open source solution for feature flagging on GitHub. There's 12 official client and server SDKs and 10+ community SDKs available; you can even make your own if you want to. You can use Unleash with any language and any framework.
